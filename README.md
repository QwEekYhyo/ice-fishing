# Ice Fishing 🎣🐧

An icy lake, a bunch of fishes and a fishing rod, the only thing missing to make any man happy would probably be a cold beer. Welcome to the ***Ice Fishing*** project!
A very minimalistic 2D game about a penguin fishing in ice and a remake of one of my favorite mini-games of Club Penguin.

Club Penguin was the very first computer game I played back when I was a child
and I have so many great great memories about it so that's why I went with this when I thought that making a 2D game in C would be a great project.

I also plan on trying to make a neural network that plays the game using the library I am coding in C: [New Chad Neural](https://github.com/QwEekYhyo/new-chad-neural).

## Build 🛠️

In order to build the game from source you will need:
- SDL3
- SDL3_ttf
- SDL3_image

## Credits 🙏

Obviously I should thank [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) which is the graphics library I am using to draw everything.
I should also mention that the font I am using in the game (it looks like the one from Club Penguin) is from [Web Fonts](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com).
